# Regression-California-Houses-prices
## Overview
This project involves predicting median house values using different regression models on the California housing dataset and calculating the median squared error and median absloute error for each of the models
## Objectives
   1. Split dataset into training set (70%),validation set (15%) and testing set(15%).
   2. Apply linear, lasso and ridge regression to the data to predict the median house value.
   3. Report Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Errors for all models.
   4. Compare between the performances of the different models
   

## Dataset
The dataset is derived from the 1990 California census and includes various features related to housing, such as:

* Median Income

* Median Age of Houses

* Total Rooms

* Total Bedrooms

* Population

* Households

* Geographic Coordinates (Latitude, Longitude)

* Distance to major cities and the coast

## Requirements
Ensure you have the required libraries installed
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Results
Comparison between perferomance of linear,lasso and ridge regression in predicting median house value and calculation of MSE and MAE
